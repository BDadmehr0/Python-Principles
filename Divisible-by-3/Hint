This is not covered in the course. You'll have to use the modulo operator, which is expressed with the percentage sign: %.

You can experiment to figure out how it works with this example:

for i in range(10):
    print(i % 3)

You can also google it.

Another hint: compare the result of applying the operator to 0.
