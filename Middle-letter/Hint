First check if the string's length is even, and if so, return "". You can use the % (modulo) operator to check. An even string's length modulo 2 is 0, while an odd string's length modulo 2 is 1. You can google "python check if number is even or odd" for clarification.

Also, note that in Python, an index must be an integer, not a floating-point number. So 2 is a valid index, but 2.0 is not. Therefore use integer division // to calculate the index, or cast the float to an integer with int().
