Split the problem up into subproblems:

First find the smallest number.

Then find the largest number.

Then compute their difference and return it.

To find the smallest number you can use the min() built-in. Alternatively you can set smallest = 100 and loop over each number in the input list. Whenever you see a smaller one, set smallest to it.
